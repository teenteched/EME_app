## EME_app

The application is designed for children and teenagers in the age group of 8-13 years. The course comes in two options: as an online platform for the regions where internet access is not a problem and in an offline version through a mobile application. 

The offline version is suitable for children who live in rural areas without internet coverage or where the price of internet services and the availability of a device is an issue. The course includes an interactive educational application/platform with all content translated to a native language of the country where the course will be studied and kits for practicing the engineering course. 

In the offline version the application comes with a tablet, so every child can have access to the content of the course. The course consists of four main components: English, Mathematics, Engineering and Final Project and is structured as a chain. After completing one subject, the next one will be opened to study. 

Registration of a user on the application/platform is carried out by taking a picture of a child and entering a username and the age. After registration, login will be performed by face recognition. Our application/platform includes evaluation tests and final quizzes to pass the courses. 

After completing all three subjects, children will have access to the final project which upon completion will be presented and rewarded.

Below is the demo video of the prototype of the solution. As it can be seen from the video the English course contains the 15 lessons for different topics with the welcoming introductiory video. Each lesson designed in such a way that contains several topics, exercisez to practice and new vocabulary with hangouts.
